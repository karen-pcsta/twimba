# Twimba

Twimba is a small project that we worked on module 5 of Scrimba's Frontend career path, where we used JS to recreate the interaction with the like, retweet and comment buttons, while also enabling simple tweets to be rendered on the feed.

## Lessons Learned

After completing this module, I decided to recreate the JS part of Twimba so I could put into practice what I had learned.

In this project we studied the following concepts:

* textarea
* .forEach()
* Data atributes
* Conditionally render styles
* The not operator(!)
* CDN's
    * Add Icons and Generate UUID.
